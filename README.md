What does it sound like?

The purpose of this project was to only use css

Conceptually, it asks the question, "Do you really see what you think you're seeing"
since everything is presented seperately, one assumes through impicit order that they are reading, 
when in actuallity, one is simply putting a number of seperate instances together even though nothing is displayed together.

Should one actually only say each letter individually, or pretend that they are reading?
